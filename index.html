   In modern times, Java is one of the most popular programming languages as it can be used to design customized
    applications that are light and fast and serve a variety of purposes. According to the TIOBE Index for April 2022, 
    Java is among the top three programming languages.</p>
    <p class="">There are many Integrated development environments (IDEs) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. <span class="fw-bolder">Powerful Java IDEs such as Eclipse,
        NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.</span> play a big role in the success of Java. These IDEs provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support,
         automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster. Java has created a base for the Android operating system and opted around 90% of fortune 500 companies to develop 
         a lot of back-end applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data processing, Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, etc.

<p class="">Java is quite easy to learn and can be understood in a short span of time as it has a syntax similar to English. You can also follow Java Tutorials.
     This will guide you on how to get started with Java and make yourself proficient in it. </p>
<p class="">Java has an abundant<span class="fw-bolder">Application Programming Interface (API)</span> that includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is useful for constructing
     applications without necessarily knowing their inside implementations. Java has mainly three types of API i.e. Official Java core APIs, Optional official 
     Java APIs, and Unofficial APIs. These APIs overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O, databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.

<p class=""><span class="fw-bolder">Java is platform-independent</span> as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known 
    as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent. Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX
     platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.
